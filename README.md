## Introduction
Needless to say, fossil fuels cause irreversible damage to the environment. In addition, it is only a matter of time before they run out. Hence, we have no choice but to replace them with a healthier and more abundant energy source. Solar panels are one good option, being used substantially in some countries such as Switzerland. A potential setback of this remarkable technology is its installation costs, which prevent the majority of the middle class from installing and using them. To resolve this issue, some governments provide financial aid to facilitate people in installing solar panels. The initial question that led to conducting the research at hand was whether these fundings were biased towards the poor or the rich; or were they, in fact, balanced and equally distributed.


## Process
Through the course of the research, we used the country of Switzerland as our sample and started investigating its social attributes, such as people's income, the number of households, the amount of given financial aid, and so on. Using such features and Causal Inference, an area of Mathematics dedicated to detecting causal relationships, we assessed the relationship between people's income and the given financial aid.

## Results
The results of this project are explained exhaustively in the paper.
